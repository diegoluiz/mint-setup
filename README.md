Lazy script for Setup
=================

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/diegoluiz/linux-setup/master/script.sh | bash -E -
```


**Still not tested**, as i built it last time I reinstalled my system (I believe it will take a couple of years until I need to resintall it again)

Built over Linux Mind 18.1 Cinnamon 64-bit
